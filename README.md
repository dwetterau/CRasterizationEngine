====================

I made this is 2012 after reading some papers online about the necessary matrix
operations to render scenes in three dimensions.

I was taking a linear algebra class at the time and figured that writing my own
matrix library in C and doing something cool with it would be worth my time.

The following year I took an operating systems class that culminated in my
project partner and I porting this to the operating system we wrote and
successfully running it.

To run this, run the compile file and then run the test binary that it
generates.  You can use the arrow keys to change the camera's view.

Here is what it looks like while running: ![Box wireframe and
